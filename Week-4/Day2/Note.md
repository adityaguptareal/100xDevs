# Why the HTTP Protocol?

The HTTP protocol is essential because it enables machines to communicate with each other over the internet. This communication is the backbone of web interactions, allowing browsers to request and receive web pages from servers.

When you type a URL into your browser, an HTTP request is sent to the server hosting the website. The server then processes this request and returns the appropriate response, which your browser displays as a web page.

## What is an IP Address?

An IP address, or Internet Protocol address, is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. Think of it as the digital address of your computer, smartphone, or any other device that connects to the internet.

Just like your home address allows mail to be delivered to your house, an IP address ensures that data sent over the internet reaches the correct destination.

### Use the command to check the IP address of any website:


## Domain

A domain is essentially a human-readable name that is mapped to a server's IP address. When someone types the domain name into their browser, the domain name system (DNS) translates this name into the corresponding IP address of the server hosting the website. This process allows users to access websites without needing to remember complex numerical IP addresses.

For example, when you type "example.com" into your browser, the DNS resolves this domain name to the server's IP address where the website's content is stored. This seamless translation is what makes navigating the internet user-friendly and efficient.
